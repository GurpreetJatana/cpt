<p> <font color=black><h2> Work I've done</h2><p>
  <p><h9> Over the past couple months we've done alot of work to help us learn more about techongoly. Here are some pecies of work that Im very pround of and want to show you guys. </h9></p>
  <p><h9>The first one I would like to show is my website. I made this an online jelwery store. I named my store Jadie which means edmerld in greek, one of the most vauleable gemstones in the world. This was the first time I used wix to create a website.</h9></p>
<a href="https://354230889.wixsite.com/my-site-1">Jadie Jelwery Store</a>
<p> This is only one of the works I've done there is many many more. Like for example I am going to show you the social media pledge I made. People spend alot of time. This is to help people who do use it. In fact did you know that being on your device for a long amount of time can affect your eyesight? </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Paq00u5qm9BBNMPPwLXk50QmNLOAaOlBlyMY5NRFbrY/edit"> Social media pledge</a>
<p> In this assigment we were asked to do reserch about a desptop software program. I chose venngage. Venngage is a software similar to canva and easy to use. Here I made a quick prestation about how to use venngage and then made a video about how to use it.</p>

<p> This assigment was the first time of me using prestation and also the first time using templates which was very exciting for me. I was able to create this prestation in under 30 miuntes thanks to the template and because of this I've learned that using templates is effortless and easy to use and gives you a good looking presatation in a short amount of time. Here is this link for it</p>
